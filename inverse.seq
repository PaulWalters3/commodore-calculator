                INVERSE

 
    Most function keys perform two
    functions, a primary function
    and an INVERSE or SECOND
    FUNCION.  Before performing this
    SECOND FUNCTION, you must hit
    the <f1> key to turn on the 
    INVERSE.  INV will appear on the
    left side of the screen.
    Reference to the INVERSE FUNCTION
    is made throughout the HELP
    screens when the INVERSE FUNCTION
    is required.
