              PERMUTATION


    nPr = n!/(n-r)!

    n = number of objects
    r = number taken at a time

    To get the number of possible
    arrangements from a grouping,
    enter the number of objects,
    n, then the <f1> key for INVERSE,
    then the <clear/home> key for
    nPr, then the number taken at
    a time, r, then the equal sign.

    KEY IN :  2<f1><clear>2=
    ANSWER :  2
