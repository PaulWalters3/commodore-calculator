              BASE SYSTEM


    On CALCULATOR, there are four
    different number bases.  They
    are BINARY, OCTAL, HEXADECIMAL,
    and DECIMAL.  To convert
    between bases, hit the @ key
    followed by the first letter of
    the name of the base you wish
    to convert to.  The current 
    base is displayed on the left
    side of the screen.

    CONVERT TO BINARY:
    KEY IN :  5  (from decimal base)
    KEY IN :  @
    KEY IN :  B
    ANSWER :  101
